# Supervised Learning Projects Showcase

This repository contains 10 small projects focused on various **supervised learning tasks**, spanning from traditional classifiers to advanced computer vision and transformer architectures. Each project tackles a unique challenge, ranging from statistical comparisons of machine learning algorithms to training deep learning models for object detection, image classification, and sequence analysis.

Below is a brief summary of the objectives of each project:

### Project Summaries

1. **Classifier Comparison**  
   Objective: Perform a statistical comparison between different classifiers across four distinct datasets.

2. **Ensemble Learning**  
   Objective: Train and compare the performance of multiple ensemble learning algorithms.

3. **Object Localization**  
   Objective: Localize an object within an image using two methods: template matching with a sliding window and a keypoints-based approach.

4. **Face Detection with Viola-Jones**  
   Objective: Train a Viola-Jones Object Detection Framework to detect faces and evaluate its performance on test images.

5. **CNN Parameter Tuning**  
   Objective: Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with various configurations of network parameters and analyze their impact on classification performance, including accuracy and misclassification.

6. **Age Prediction with Transfer Learning**  
   Objective: Apply transfer learning using pre-trained CNNs on the IMDB-WIKI dataset for age prediction, comparing models using different correlation coefficients.

7. **Text Generation with RNNs**  
   Objective: Train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and gated alternatives (LSTM, GRU) for single character generation, then use the trained models for text generation.

8. **Fast R-CNN for UNO Card Detection**  
   Objective: Train a Fast R-CNN model to detect and classify 14 symbols and numbers on UNO cards, evaluating performance using Intersection over Union (IoU).

9. **YOLOv5 Object Detection**  
   Objective: Train a small YOLOv5 model on the Vehicles-OpenImages dataset for 5-class object detection, testing the model on various images and videos.

10. **Transformer for Sequence Classification**  
    Objective: Explore the performance of a transformer-based model on a sequence classification task, analyzing the effects of sequence length and category count on model performance.
